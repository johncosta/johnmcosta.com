# Overview
After reading [One Bold Move a Day](/2023/11/12/one-bold-move-a-day-meaningful-actions.html) I decided to create a 
checklist for my coaching interactions. This includes being coached as well as a template for those I plan to coach.
This checklist is a work in progress and will be updated as I learn more about coaching and leadership.

## The 5x15 Weekly Update [^1][^2]

Something I've been doing for a while now has been to provide a weekly update to my manager. This update includes a 
list of wins and accolades.  I've found this to be a great way to keep track of my accomplishments and to help me
remember them when it comes time for my annual review. The gist is that you create an update to manage up which takes 
no longer than 15 minutes to create and no longer than 5 minutes to read.

You might find that you cover all this in your 1:1s with your manager.  It may be that this is good enough for you or 
your manager. For other's in organizations where there's a lot of competition, writing this out on a weeky basis is a 
great way to advocate for yourself week over week and make writing your yearly review easier. 

To build this out, I've decided to use the [5x15](https://dandoadvisors.com/5-15-format/) format. Here's an example 
template:

```markdown

## By Section

### Are you planning to work next week, from <day> to </day>?

This helps your manager know if you're planning to take time off.  If you are, it shouldn't be a surprise to them.  As 
a manager, a gentle reminder about who will be unavailable can be helpful when you're reflecting on the past week or 
looking forward to the next.  

### Accomplishments for the week

This is where you list your wins and accolades as organized by your company's culture, your organization's culture, and 
your team's culture.  Sometimes these items may not have alignment.  This could be an opportunity to discuss this with 
your manager and see how better alignment could be achieved.  

Not everyone's comfortable with self-promotion.  This is a great way to practice.

### Priorities for next week

Keep this simple.  List your top 3 priorities for the next week.  This is a great way to keep your manager informed of 
what you're working on and to help you stay focused on what's important.  If you're not sure what your priorities are,
this is a great opportunity to discuss this with your manager.

### Stats

This is a great way to keep track vital stats of your work persona.

#### Energy level

"Different people are engergized or exhausted by different things."[^4] This is a way to keep your manager informed of
what's going on in your work and/or your life. Good managers will use this information to help you be successful, perhaps
providing the opportunity to coast during low energy times or to take on more challenging work during periods of high 
energy.

#### Quality of Life

How is the work/life balance?  Are you feeling overwhelmed?  Are you feeling bored?  How are you enjoying your projects 
and the people you're working with?  Not everything is going to be perfect all the time. Often times we can't change the 
situation, but we can change our perspective. Answers to how your mental or physical health could also be inputs here. 
Good managers often can help with challenging situations or provide perspective to get through them. Looking for the 
positive in a situation can help us get through times when QOL is lower. 

#### Credibility

"You can build credibility by solving hard problems, being visibly competent and consistently showing good technical 
judgment."[^5] 

The approach I take here is to determine how much trust others have in what I share for technical solutions. Some 
resources might also consider this to be part of Social Capital, but my feeling is that Credibility and Social Capital 
are so integral that these are parts of the same thing.

## Checklist[^3]
