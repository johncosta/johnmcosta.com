I'm moved my blog from a canned wordpress site, to this new django powered blog.   I've forked Josh VanderLinden's <a href='https://bitbucket.org/codekoala/django-articles' target='_tab'>django-articles</a> to a private repo in BitBucket for personal development and married it with this free skin from <a href='http://www.html5webtemplates.co.uk/' target='_tab'>FreeHtml5Templates</a>.
